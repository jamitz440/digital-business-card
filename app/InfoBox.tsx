          I am an A Tech (Av) by trade with a passion for coding. I got into web
          development because I love the flexibility it offers â€“ there&apos;s
          always more than one way to solve a problem or create something cool.
          My experience includes developing engineering programs for aircraft
          and some sideprojects in django and react. I tackle challenges
          head-on, believing there&apos;s a solution to every problem. When
          I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m usually gaming or experimenting with my
          3D printer.
